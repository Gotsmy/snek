* in_demands and out_demands that lists all reactions that are not mass-balanced and have lower bounds below 0 and upper bounds above 0 respectively <-  i think it would be rather nice to have a function that lists all reactions with unusual boundaries.
* some advanced exchange reactions function that catches all reactions that are not mass balanced, not only exchange reactions <- this is actually done by model.boundaries (if the model is set up correctly)
* rewrite the carbon fluxes to elemental fluxes function
